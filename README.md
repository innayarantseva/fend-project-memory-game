# Memory Game Project

It's a simple matching game build with pure JabaScript, CSS and JS â€” no frameworks at all!

The project is a task from Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.

## Task Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
